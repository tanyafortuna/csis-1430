      <p>I'm not the average college student. Not now, anyway. I was a lot more average 20 years ago when I got my first degree. After graduating I carved a career out of being able to "figure it out" - starting in a mathematics field and pivoting to manual Quality Assurance, then later to Quality Engineering. I had to learn a lot as I went and, though I always made it work, I never really felt that I had a strong grasp on the foundations of the languages and technologies I was using. I was convinced I was just scraping by and fooling everyone in the process.</p>
      <p>Then, a decade ago, I was promoted and started my journey on the management track. Like many managers, I spent most of my time coordinating people and projects rather than coding directly. I felt very disconnected from the technologies being used by those I led. Oh, I understood at a high level, but I completely lost confidence in my ability to use them myself.</p>
      <p>A few years ago, I had to take a leave from the workforce for health reasons. When I finally was ready to come back, I was brought to tears looking at job listings for Quality Engineering positions. I felt I'd never qualify for any of the jobs because of the strong technical skills they wanted. Even worse, I didn't really want to go back to QE. Although I love it, QE lacks the same stability that Software Development has, but the last thing I wanted was to pivot yet again to another field where I didn't have the skills and confidence to succeed. There was no way I could transition to development without some serious training, and the best plan I could come up with brought me to SLCC.</p>
      <p>I felt hopeful yet intimidated to be back in college, but I was put at ease immediately by the two professors I had this semester. One of my instructors, Jeff, has a methodology which includes students making 5-minute websites during every class. The reinforcement of knowledge that comes from this practice helped me discover that I know a whole lot more than I gave myself credit for. The repetition of the 5-minute websites was comforting and familiar. My previous work experience was broader than I realized, and I had been underestimating my knowledge, background, and ability to learn new technologies.</p>
      <p>The self-confidence I gained from this class pushed me to go above and beyond in my assignments and make sites I could be truly proud of as portfolio projects. I dreamed up a wild idea to make a site look like it was typing out a story. Did it matter that it was only my second website using Javascript? Nope! I found a guide and I knew I could figure out how to apply it to my page. Making responsive websites seemed like a lot to juggle, and I wanted to shy away from the challenge...so I made my last few projects responsive, even though it wasn't required, for the practice.</p>
      <p>Somewhere along the way in my career, a little whisper of doubt became a deafening roar. With the help of this class, I've quieted my doubts and found that I believe in myself again. Not that I'm ready for my new career just yet - but I know to my core that I am capable of getting there and it'll be less daunting than I thought. I didn't expect a college class to be quite so therapeutic, but here I am with a regained sense of pride and confidence. I'm very thankful.</p>
